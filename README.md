This repository contains code for the paper [Safety-Enhanced Autonomous Driving Using Interpretable Sensor Fusion Transformer](https://github.com/opendilab/InterFuser). We will release the code soon.

This work fully processes and fuses information from multi-modal multi-view sensors for achieving comprehensive scene understanding. Besides, intermediate interpretable features are generated from our framework, which provide more semantics and are exploited to better constrain actions to be within the safe sets.
Our method achieves new state-of-the-art on [CARLA AD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.carla.org/leaderboard/) by June 11 2022.
